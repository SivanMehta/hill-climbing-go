Trying to implement [hill climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing) to estimate the maximum value between x = [0, 10] for the following function in `go`:

```
y = sin(x)
```

The correct answers(s) is are (π / 2, 1) and/or (5π / 2, 1)


Run `make` to run the optimization:

```sh
make
``
